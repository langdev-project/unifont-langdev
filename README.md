#  UNIFONT-LANGDEV  #

Unifont-LANGDEV is an expansion of the [GNU Unifont](http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html) which includes LANGDEV glyphs and common characters used for transcription and punctuation (these latter characters are borrowed from the original Unifont).
Also included are some (not necessarily complete) hex and png files for a 32px version (however, as hex2sfd does not currently handle these hex files properly, no TTF can been generated).

To build the font, simply run `make`.
