# Default values, if not set on the command line when make is invoked:
#
# FONTFILE:  Prefix of the file name for input and output files.
# FONTNAME:  Name of the font inside a TTF file.
# PSNAME:    PostScript name of the font inside a TTF file; can't have spaces.

# Go Note: I've added 16HEX which is the folder of the 16px hex files,
# 32HEX which is the folder of the 32px hex files, and SPACES which is
# the spaces.hex file. FONTNAME32 and PSNAME32 give the names for the

# The PostScript name of a font can't contain spaces--remove them.
# Could also use bash string replacement if you know you're using bash.
#

# Go Note: The Unifont LANGDEV TTF only contains LANGDEV glyphs, which
# were created by me. The full Unifont project has a much longer list

# How to build unifont.ttf from GNU Unifont's unifont.hex
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Written by Luis Alejandro Gonzalez Miranda - http://www.lgm.cl/
#

#
# 2008 - Paul Hardy created this Makefile from Luis' original
# howto-build.sh and other bash scripts.  Those original scripts
# don't appear in this archive, but they can be retrieved from
# http://www.lgm.cl/.
#

# First of all, you need a Perl interpreter and FontForge.
#
# I don't remember all the steps, but I think it was as described by
# this script.

# This division is done only so the Simplify and RemoveOverlap
# operations don't use up too much memory, and because
# a .sfd generated from the whole unifont.hex would be too big to
# process all at once.

# Go Note: Right now 32px fonts aren't handled properly by hex2sfd :(

# all: 16 32
just16: 16

# Go Note: I've added a few lines to move the font and combining
# files out into the open if they aren't already.

# This fontforge script reads a BDF font file and generates an SBIT font file.
# Author: written by Qianqian Fang, given to Paul Hardy in 2008.
# The SBIT font is far smaller than the default outline TrueType font
# and takes far less time to build than the outline font.  However, it
# isn't scalable.  An SBIT font could be created and merged with the
# larger TTF font using fontforge, but I (Paul Hardy) haven't noticed
# any degradation in the screen rendering of just the outline TTF font
# that this Makefile produces as its final product.  This is with
# daily use of this Makefile's default TrueType font.
#
# This builds an SBIT font from the unifont_sample BDF font.  The
# BDF font already contains font name, etc., so they don't need to
# be set using SetFontNames; those parameters are left null so the
# existing font's values will be preserved.  However, Fontforge
# does not read the FONT_VERSION property so Paul Hardy added the
# the SetFontNames call.
#
# Commented out because not all applications correctly interpreted
# the settings:
#
#	    SetFontNames("","","","","","$(VERSION)"); \
